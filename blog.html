        <p>The DOM is Document Object Model and it's a programming interface for web documents.It defines the logical
            structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. The DOM represents the document
            as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
            The DOM is a tree-like representation of the web page that gets loaded into the browser. <br> In website
            development, DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface that allows us to create,
            change, or remove elements from a website document. DOM manipulation is when you use JavaScript to add,
            remove, and modify elements of a website. It is very common in web development.

        <h1 class="text-2xl font-medium pb-2 pt-6">How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.
        </h1>
        <p> The Select object in HTML DOM is used to represent an HTML <select> element. The <select> element can be
                    created by using the document. createElement() method and it can be accessed using the
                    getElementById(). The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It
                    represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM
                    represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the
                    page.<br> <br> There are 5 ways in which you can select elements in a DOM using
                    selectors.
                    <br>
                    1. getElementsByTagName() Method. <br>
                    2. getElementsByClassName() Method. <br>
                    3. getElementById() Method. <br>
                    4. querySelector() Method. <br>
                    5. querySelectorAll() Method.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium pb-2 pt-6">What is event bubble?</h2>
        <p>What is Event Bubbling? Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model). It happens when an
            element receives an event, and that event bubbles up (or you can say is transmitted or propagated) to its
            parent and ancestor elements in the DOM tree until it gets to the root element. The major use of event
            bubbling is the registration of default functions present in the program. In recent times, not many
            developers use event capturing or bubbling in particular. Event bubbling is a type of DOM event propagation
            where the event first triggers on the innermost target element, and then successively triggers on the
            ancestors of the target element in the same nesting hierarchy till it reaches the outermost DOM element or
            document object.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium pb-2 pt-6">What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h2>
        <p>A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside
            the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. The above example is a synchronous callback,
            as it is executed immediately. When you want one function to execute only after another function has
            completed its execution, we use callback functions in JavaScript. It needs to pass as a parameter to other
            functions to make a function callback. A callback function is a function passed into another function as an
            argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.</p>
